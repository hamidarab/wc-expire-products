## Installation
1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.  
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.  
3. Edit a product and set the expiration date under **Product Data → General**.  
4. (Optional) Use Quick Edit in the product list to modify the expiration date quickly.
