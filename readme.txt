Manage product expiration with Persian calendar support. Auto mark products as "Out of Stock" before expiry.

== Description ==

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Add an expiration date to products via the product edit page or Quick Edit.
- ‚úÖ Display the expiration date on the product page.
- ‚úÖ Automatically set products to "Out of Stock" two months before expiration.

üóìÔ∏è **Persian Calendar Support**  
If the `jdate()` function is available (e.g., by using the WP-Parsidate plugin), the expiration dates will be displayed using the Persian (Jalali) calendar. Otherwise, it will default to the Gregorian calendar.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.
3. Edit a product and set the expiration date under **Product Data ‚Üí General**.
4. (Optional) Use Quick Edit in the product list to modify the expiration date quickly.

üóìÔ∏è **To enable Persian date format:**  
Install and activate a plugin that provides the `jdate()` function, such as [WP-Parsidate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-parsidate/). The expiration date will then be shown in the Persian (Jalali) calendar format.
